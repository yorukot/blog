# My Hardware and Software Configuration

This article is mainly about my current software configuration. Since there are way too many software configurations, I might not be able to cover everything - I'll add more as I think of them, or you can ask in the comments.

This is actually two articles - one about software, one about hardware. This one is about software, and you can [click here](/en/blog/my-configuration-hardware) to go to the hardware one.

If you think any of the setups are cool, feel free to copy them directly~

## Terminal Related

First, let me show you what my Terminal looks like in the end:

![Terminal](/blog/my-configuration-software/terminal.png)

### Terminal Emulator - Ghostty

I've been using this terminal emulator (I'll just call it terminal from now on) for a while. The main feature of this terminal is that it's written in Zig, supposedly very fast and can use GPU rendering, but honestly I can't feel any difference.

This terminal started as an idea in 2020, mainly hoping to write a terminal built for modern times. The reviews online are pretty good, and I feel really good using it too.

It also supports quite a few terminal protocols like the Kitty graphics protocol.

Below is my config file. I honestly haven't done too much configuration because I don't really need to, but it seems to have quite a few great settings you can check out in the documentation.

```toml
theme = catppuccin-mocha

font-family = "JetBrains Mono NL"
```

### Shell - Zsh

For shell, I use Zsh. From when I used Linux to MacOS, I've always used it. I haven't seriously tried other shells, but I'm used to it anyway, and I don't plan to change for now.

Below are my Zsh-related settings. Remember to install the plugins - you can Google how to install them.

```bash
# ===============================
# Path to your Oh My Zsh install
# ===============================
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

# ===============================
# Plugins (Oh My Zsh will load them)
# ===============================
plugins=(
  git
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  sudo
  extract
  zsh-bat
)

# Load Oh My Zsh
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# ===============================
# Starship prompt (must come AFTER Oh My Zsh)
# ===============================
eval "$(starship init zsh)"

# ===============================
# Custom environment variables (optional)
# ===============================
[ -f "$HOME/.local/bin/env" ] && source "$HOME/.local/bin/env"

# ===============================
# Podman & Docker compatibility
# ===============================
# Add Podman to PATH
export PATH="/opt/podman/bin:$PATH"
# Alias Docker command to use Podman
alias docker=podman

# ===============================
# Conda initialization (auto-generated)
# ===============================
__conda_setup="$('/Users/yorukot/miniconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.zsh' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
elif [ -f "/Users/yorukot/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
    source "/Users/yorukot/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
else
    export PATH="/Users/yorukot/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
fi
unset __conda_setup

# ===============================
# FZF initialization
# ===============================
[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.fzf.zsh

# ===============================
# vim alias
# ===============================
alias vim=nvim

# ===============================
# Golang
# ===============================
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"

# ===============================
# git
# ===============================
export VISUAL=nvim
export EDITOR=nvim

# ===============================
# Rust
# ===============================
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# ===============================
# Zoxide
# ===============================
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"

# ===============================
# exa (eza)
# ===============================
alias ls='eza --icons -lh --no-user'

# ===============================
# bun
# ===============================
[ -s "/Users/yorukot/.bun/_bun" ] && source "/Users/yorukot/.bun/_bun"

export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"

# ===============================
# Bat with tail
# ===============================
logs() {
  if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
    echo "error: Please specify a log file."
    return 1
  fi

  tail -f "$1" | bat --paging=never -l log
}
```

#### Complex Function Configuration Explanation

Let me mainly talk about my more complex function configurations:

- `logs` - This is mainly about turning tail into a bat-formatted effect, which looks more comfortable. You can see the difference in the image below (right side is logs, left side is regular tail)

![Normal tail vs. tail with bat](/blog/my-configuration-software/tail-vs-bat.png)

### Terminal Prompt - Starship

If you carefully read my configuration in the Shell section above, you should have noticed that I use Starship for terminal prompt.

Starship is a very fast terminal prompt. So what is a terminal prompt? Simply put, it's the thing that makes your terminal display stuff like what you see below.

![Terminal prompt](/blog/my-configuration-software/terminal-prompt.png)

Below is my Starship configuration. It's actually just some basic stuff, nothing much to say. If you're interested, you can check out the Starship documentation.

```toml
"$schema" = 'https://starship.rs/config-schema.json'

format = """

# Here is how you can shorten some long paths by text replacement
# similar to mapped_locations in Oh My Posh:
[directory.substitutions]
"Documents" = "󱔘"
"Downloads" = " "
"Music" = " "
"Pictures" = " "
# Keep in mind that the order matters. For example:
# "Important Documents" = "  "
# will not be replaced, because "Documents" was already substituted before.
# So either put "Important Documents" before "Documents" or use the substituted version:
